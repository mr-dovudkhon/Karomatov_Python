# Algorithm Implementation Readme

## Description
This Python script contains an algorithm that performs different actions based on user input. It provides functionalities for greeting, checking numeric inputs, extracting multiples of 3 from a list, and checking if a name matches "John".

## Features
1. Greeting:
   - If the entered number is greater than 7, the script prints "Hello".

2. Name Check:
   - If the entered name matches "John", it outputs "Hello, John"; otherwise, it prompts the user to enter "John".

3. Multiples of 3:
   - If a numeric array is entered, the script outputs array elements that are multiples of 3.

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter either a number, a name, or an array (comma-separated) as per the instructions.
3. Follow the prompts to provide the necessary inputs.
4. The script will execute the corresponding action based on the input.

## Example
Enter Number, Name or Array: (Note: If you want to enter array, please separate with comma.) >>> 8
Hello

Enter Number, Name or Array: (Note: If you want to enter array, please separate with comma.) >>> John
Hello, John

Enter Number, Name or Array: (Note: If you want to enter array, please separate with comma.) >>> 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
Input is a list: [1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 6.0, 9.0]
Multiples of 3: [3.0, 6.0, 9.0]
